# flask-apis
API Development with Flask

The start_internet_sales.py file, is the Flask Application's starting point. By running it, a server instance is launched, and you can consume each endpoint's content. If you want to test the app before launching the server, run **run_internet_sales_inplace.py** file and you'll get what an endpoint would deliver.
